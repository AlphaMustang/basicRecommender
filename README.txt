This is a very basic recommendation system which should help to teach me how to create more complicated recommendation systems in the future.

I am currently following this tutorial: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/recommender-systems-python 

The dataset used for this recommender can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/data

basicRecommender.py is the simple recommender from the tutorial. This file calculates a score, which is a weighted average of votes casted, and recommends 
the top 20 films from that. 

contentRecommender.py is the content based recommendation system from the tutorial. This file focusses on recommending films based on films with similar 
plots.
